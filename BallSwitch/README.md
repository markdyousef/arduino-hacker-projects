Usually made up of a cavity of some sort with a conductive free mass inside, such as a blob of mercury or rolling ball. One end of the cavity has two conductive elements (poles). When the sensor is oriented so that end is downwards, the mass rolls onto the poles and shorts them, acting as a switch throw.
